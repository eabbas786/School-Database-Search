# School-Database-Search
This database allows a user to search for the first and last offerings by a school through a school's database.
The program stores all of the entries from the database in a hash map, where the course names are the keys. Each value is a set containing all of the term numbers for the course. Each term number is calculated from the season and year for each course offering.
To interact with the program, the user enters a course name and the program returns the first time and last time that the course was offered, if offered at all, using an iterator.
